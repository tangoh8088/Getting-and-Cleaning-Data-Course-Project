## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
### Introduction
This is the course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

###The script and the tidy data set
The R script run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Downloads and unzips the zip file
2. Loads the activity labels, features and data sets
3. Tidies up the features names
4. Merges the data sets and extracts only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Labels the merged data set with descriptive activity names and descriptive variable names
6. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each acitivty and each subject, also found in this repository

### The Code Book
The CodeBook.md file explains and describes the variables, data and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
